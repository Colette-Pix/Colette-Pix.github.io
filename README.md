I used Html, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

I made a dating site for aliens. You have a home page, a profile from user's POV, and a search page.

To do searches, type in the name of the alien (you can get the names from the home page or the aliensData3.js),
fill out anything for the other data (for now, only name is used in the search)
the click the search button and the alien's data will be displayed.
